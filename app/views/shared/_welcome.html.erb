  <div class="prose lg:prose-xl">

    <p>
      This very minimal and simple Ruby on Rails application runs the <strong>PRO version</strong> of <a href="https://www.maglev.dev" target="_blank">MaglevCMS</a>, the most advanced page builder gem in Rails.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some features included in the demo app:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>an user has many sites</li>
      <li>a new site is generated from one of the 2 themes included in the app</li>
      <li>the content of each site is edited thanks to the awesome UI/UX of Maglev</li>
      <li>a TLS certificate is generated for each site with a valid domain (require a DNS operation on your side).</li>
      <li>a Kamal deployment config file has been added</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i class="ri-github-fill text-2xl"></i> The code source of the application can be found <a href="https://github.com/maglevhq/site-builder-demo" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
